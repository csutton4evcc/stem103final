#  ✨ STEM 103 - Final Project Example ✨

Here's some example code that may help you create your final project. 

As a reminder, you may not directly copy this code for any project you complete.

Seeing this code work can be accomplished in several ways!

- Learn to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository in GitHub, then launch a codespace from your new repo
- Create a new project in PyCharm, then copy the code into two new appropriately named .py files
